# Relational-DBMS-Queries-



1) For the Database system project 1 we have used MySQL Workbench. 
2) First of all we have created a database schema and after that we have created tables one by one. 
3) For creating a table, we have first saw the entries of each column to know about the datatypes of the column. We note all the column name and there datatpyes.
4) As we had the column name and datatype we have created table by giving column names and appropriate datatype.(Need to be done carefully as it is very difficult to change after table is created)
5) After creating tables in MySQL Workbench we have imported the given enteries of each column for each table. The field of the file is terminated by a comma indicated by  FIELD TERMINATED BY ',' and enclosed by double quotation marks specified by ENCLOSED BY '" â€˜.Each line of the CSV file is terminated by a newline 
6) Then we checked every table by doing SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME to see everthing is proper or not.
7) We have performed 5 SQL queries and saved the result in .csv file(eg. Answer1.csv)
